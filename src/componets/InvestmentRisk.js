          All investments come with the risk of losing money. Investing involves
          substantial risks, including complete possible loss of principal plus
          other losses and may not be suitable for many members of the public.
          Investments, unlike savings and checking accounts at a bank, are not
          insured by the government to protect against market losses. Different
          market instruments carry different types and degrees of risk and you
          should familiarize yourself with the risks involved in the particular
          market instruments you intend to invest in.
